# worldhood

**Explore the world, and build your own corner of it.**

An open-source city playground in your browser. Explore Helsinki and Tampere by car, on foot,
by bicycle or on an e-scooter. Greet people, try another car, or help recreate a place you know.
The streets and buildings come from open map and city data, with local details added by contributors.

**Play: [worldhood.org](https://worldhood.org)**

The current game is single-player. A shared online world and player-owned territories are future
plans. Adding and improving cities currently happens through this repository, rather than an in-game editor.

The game runs entirely in the browser (three.js + Vite), with no account, backend or API key needed
to play. Optional contributor tools that fetch data or process reference photos may require their
own API keys; see `.env.example` and the city-building guide.

Originally built by [Lasse](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lassesaari/). **Contributors welcome: build a place you know, improve the shared engine, or help test and explain the game.**

Read the **[vision](docs/VISION.md)**, find an idea in the [wishlist](docs/IDEAS.md), or start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Have an idea? [Tell me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lassesaari/).

## Run

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Use Node.js 22 or newer. Open the URL Vite prints in a modern browser with WebGL2.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| W / S or ↑ / ↓ | Accelerate / brake and reverse |
| A / D or ← / → | Steer |
| Space | Brake (car, bicycle or scooter) |
| F | Get out of the car / get off a ride |
| Enter | Enter a nearby stopped car / mount a bicycle or scooter |
| Shift (hold) | Run while on foot |
| G | Greet a nearby person / end a conversation |
| R | Back to your starting point |
| M | City map and starting points |
| C | Drive / Follow / High camera |
| Q / E (hold) | Look left / right |
| T | Time of day / weather |
| H | Hide the HUD |
| V | Capture mode (full resolution, no camera shake) |

On a phone, slide the steering control and hold **Go**; **Brake** slows down, then reverses.
**Menu** contains the map, camera, weather, sound and steering choices. Small context buttons
let you get out, run, use a nearby ride or greet someone.

```sh
npm test          # unit tests
npm run build     # static build in dist/, deployable to any static host
```

## Cities

<!-- CITIES:START -->
| City | Play | Status | Data | Maintainers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Helsinki, Finland | [`?city=helsinki`](https://worldhood.org/?city=helsinki) | playable | City of Helsinki 3D city model + open data, HSL | wanted |
| Tampere, Finland | [`?city=tampere`](https://worldhood.org/?city=tampere) | draft | OpenStreetMap | wanted |
<!-- CITIES:END -->

Running it locally? Use `http://localhost:5173/?city=<id>`.

## Improve the game engine

Movement, vehicle entry, conversations, police, cameras and touch controls are shared across cities.
Work on rendering and streaming helps every place load and play better. Start with the
[engine code map](docs/GAMEPLAY.md), choose a small improvement, and include a reproducible
example or a test for the behaviour you change. You do not need to build a city to contribute.

## Build your own city

**Not a programmer?** Start with **[docs/START_HERE.md](docs/START_HERE.md)**: a plain-language,
step-by-step guide. Local knowledge, properly licensed reference material and testing all help.
You can work with another contributor or a coding agent; AI tools are optional.

Any city works, starting from just its name:

```sh
npm run city:new   -- tampere "Tampere, Finland" 1500   # find it, set the playable radius (m)
npm run city:build -- tampere                            # OpenStreetMap → game data
npm run dev                                              # then open /?city=tampere
```

You get:
- 3D buildings at their mapped heights
- streets with real surfaces (cobblestones rumble)
- water, parks and trees
- a routable traffic network with traffic lights, used by traffic and pedestrians
- tram and bus lines with stops, from OpenStreetMap routes
- start points at the city's best-known places

A fresh build is only a starting point. Refine a small area street by street using permitted
reference material: buildings, trees, signs, surfaces, local buses and trams. Drafts can be
reviewed with their gaps documented; recognisable, carefully checked streets are the aim. The step-by-step **[playbook](docs/BUILD_YOUR_CITY.md)** ends with
a ready-made **agent prompt** you can paste into your own coding agent so it builds your city for
you.

### Add your city to the game

1. **Fork** this repository and create a branch, e.g. `city/tampere`.
2. **Build:**
   - `npm run city:new -- <id> "<City, Country>"`, then `npm run city:build -- <id>`.
   - The build also adds your city to the table above, via `npm run cities:readme`.
3. **Make it yours:**
   - Put your GitHub handle in `maintainers` in `cities/<id>/city.json`.
   - Add these lines to `.github/CODEOWNERS`:
     ```
     /cities/<id>/          @you
     /public/cities/<id>/   @you
     ```
4. **Check:** run `npm test` and `npm run build`. Then drive every start point at
   `/?city=<id>` with no console errors.
5. **Open a pull request** titled `City: <name>`. The template asks for:
   - 3–5 screenshots;
   - the `?city=<id>&start=<place>` links;
   - your data sources.

   Commit `cities/<id>/`, `public/cities/<id>/`, `public/cities/index.json` and the README change.
   Never commit `data/raw/` or `.env.local`.
6. **Review:**
   - An automated check runs the tests and build.
   - A maintainer drives it and merges it as `draft`.
   - It moves to `reviewed` once the [playbook](docs/BUILD_YOUR_CITY.md) stage 3–4 checks pass and
     a local confirms.

Building the data yourself is optional: you can open an **Area claim** / city issue and ask
someone to help.

## The map

- The core area is a 2 km circle around Helsinki Cathedral.
- **Extensions** add more areas: the Mannerheimintie → Töölö → Seurasaari corridor, Länsiväylä over
  Lauttasaari and Koivusaari, and on into Espoo (Keilaniemi, Otaniemi, Tapiola) on Espoo's own open 3D city model.
- **Pick a city and start point** in the URL: `?city=helsinki&start=seurasaari-bridge` or
  `?city=tampere`.
- Coordinates are local metres (X east, Z south) from each city’s configured origin. Helsinki uses 24.9522 E, 60.1701 N and the municipal
  ETRS-GK25 projection (EPSG:3879).

The game is not a survey-exact digital twin:
- Terrain depends on the city: Tampere uses bundled elevation data; Helsinki and the Espoo extension currently use flattened ground.
- Some façades and landmark details are approximations.
- Traffic, pedestrians and police are simulated.

## Rebuilding data

Runtime data is bundled in `public/data` and `public/cities/<id>`; optional regions and distant scenery load as needed. To refresh it from the public sources:

```sh
npm run data:fetch && npm run data:build
npm run data:textured
npm run data:mobility
```
