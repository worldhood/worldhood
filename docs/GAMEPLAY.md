# Improving gameplay: code map, workflow and pull requests

The game is plain JavaScript modules on three.js, bundled by Vite. There's no framework or
backend. Most logic is pure functions with unit tests; rendering modules turn their state into
meshes.

## Where things are

| Area | Modules | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Boot, game loop, HUD, input | `src/main.js`, `index.html`, `src/style.css` | `boot()` loads data and builds the world; `frame()` runs each tick |

## Shared player gameplay

These mechanics belong to the engine, not to a particular city. Every new city uses the same
`PlayerTravel` controller and `PeopleInteraction` system with its own collision map and actors.
Do not add city-name checks to the movement, mounting, input or conversation code.

- **F** gets out of a stopped car or off a stopped ride. The vehicle remains where it was left.
- **WASD / arrows** move; hold **Shift** to run. Touch players can toggle **Run**.
- **Enter** uses a nearby stopped car, bicycle or scooter; **Space** brakes.
- **G** greets a nearby person or seller; choose follow-up replies. **G**, **Escape**, goodbye or
  walking away ends the conversation.
- On a phone, small context buttons provide the same actions. Hints fade and do not cover the player.

One usable bicycle and scooter are placed on clear ground near each start. They are gameplay
objects, not claims about real rental availability. Placed bicycles and scooters also expose
`rideSources`: a stable ID, mode, actor, visual description and claim/release callbacks. The
controller checks space and a clear approach before claiming a ride. Taking one hides its
original model and collider; parking it leaves that same ride available to use again. Resetting
the start releases claims and restores the original placements. A city kit exposes parked cars through
`enterableCars` descriptors; the generic controller handles taking, driving, parking and resetting them.
Traffic cars can also be entered when stopped. Original models/colliders are hidden while a car is
in use, so a second copy does not remain behind. Public buses and trams remain simulated transport.

Bicycle and scooter riders share the pedestrian model. Check rider hands, feet, seat/deck contact
and vehicle ground contact from the side as well as from the chase camera when changing these models.
Scooter traffic uses the active city's walking network and paved surfaces. Riders yield to nearby
people and vehicles, stop when approached on foot, and turn back where a safe connection ends.
Route discovery is bounded and refreshes as regions stream in; do not add a city-specific spawn list.

## Conversations

Conversations are authored branches, with stable fictional names and interests derived from an
actor's ID. Characters remember topics and preferences during the current visit; resetting the start
clears that memory. Place suggestions use the active city's supplied landmarks and straight-line
bearings, not invented local businesses or promises about a walking route. Market sellers describe
their stall's actual game menu and can hand the player into that exact stall's shopping panel.

The shared person renderer accepts `expression`, `speaking` and an optional `mouthOpen` value from
0 to 1. Eye, brow and mouth detail uses the existing head instances, with animation limited to nearby
people. Speech events drive the speaking state; the mouth cycle is an approximation, not phoneme
alignment. Captions and choices work independently of audio.

Voice follows the game's sound setting, initially off. The adapter selects only browser voices marked
`localService`; if none are available or speech fails, the conversation stays in text. No API key,
microphone, generated dialogue or remote speech service is required. The
[Web Speech specification](https://webaudio.github.io/web-speech-api/#dom-speechsynthesisvoice-localservice)
defines the local/remote distinction. Cancel pending and active speech when switching lines, muting,
walking away, opening a menu, pausing, resetting or stopping the game. Restore the NPC's original pose
and route state, and keep the player free to leave.

Further interaction work is tracked in [issue #51](https://github.com/worldhood/worldhood/issues/51).
New branches should give the player a useful choice or a character detail, rather than extending
dialogue with repeated filler. Test a complete exchange, returning to the same character, a seller
handoff, interruption and a small mobile screen.

## Ice cream and gulls

Kauppatori has an illustrative ice cream seller: talk with **G**, ask about the menu, and buy a
pehmis or a flavoured cone. The item travels from the counter into the player's hand. Nearby gulls
notice it, gather and make staggered passes toward the cone. Run to keep away; repeated close
passes can knock it out of your hand. During the chase, **E** or the existing touch action drops
the cone deliberately. Gulls gather around the spill briefly, then return to their flock.

The encounter is shared gameplay. Other cities can place a stall with `kind: 'icecream'` and
provide their normal mapped gull colonies. Items opt in with `encounter: 'gulls'`; no city-name
check or extra birds are needed. `GullEncounter` owns timing, pressure and the one temporary
dropped item. `birds.js` reuses at most twelve existing gulls and its existing instanced draw call;
`safeFlight` checks low approaches against mapped buildings, stall canopies and water.

Pause freezes the encounter. Finishing the food, taking a vehicle, changing the start or stopping
the game releases it. A dropped item does not count as eaten, refund money or accumulate in the
scene. Test both the complete purchase/chase/drop loop and cancellation when adding new food.

## Physical objects

Every scenery object needs a deliberate collision role. Builders expose static footprints through
`obstacles` and other classifications through their group's `worldObjects`. The shared registry
uses the player's full footprint and checks the movement between frames, including turns and thin posts.

| Mode | Use it for | Collision behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `solid` | Low sign boards, fixed supports, barriers and substantial street furniture | Blocks cars, bicycles, scooters and walking using its footprint |
| `breakable` | Posts and loose props already registered with the moving-body simulation | The owning knockable/sign system handles impact and falling |
| `overhead` | Boards high enough to leave the playable route clear | The board does not block ground movement; give each support its own collider |
| `decoration` | Wall-mounted signs and surface marks | No additional ground collider; the supporting wall retains its own collision |

Use `solidBox()` for a rotated rectangular footprint, or supply polygon rings for an irregular shape.
This is ground-plane collision: classifying a board as overhead assumes sufficient clearance, rather
than measuring a vehicle's height at runtime. A visual sign must not silently inherit a tiny centre
post collider when its low boards extend across the player's path. Test both ends, reverse and angled
approaches, nearby clear ground, and recovery from an existing contact.

## Mobile controls

The default is proportional thumb steering with separate Go and Brake/Reverse pedals.
Menu pauses play and holds the map, camera, weather, sound, help, reset and steering settings.
Players can choose directional buttons or opt into tilt steering. Walking and riding use the
same inputs; nearby actions remain contextual.

A contact owns its input until released. Multi-touch, pointer cancellation, loss of focus,
orientation changes, menus and travel-mode changes must not leave a pedal or turn held down.
Check portrait and landscape, including a small viewport and devices with safe-area insets.
Browser emulation covers layout and pointer logic; real-device checks are still needed for
motion sensors, system gestures and sustained frame rate.

## Wanted level and police

Police rules are shared across cities. Sustained reckless driving can earn a first star;
a meaningful collision starts at two. Several distinct incidents in a short interval raise
the response faster. Low-speed parking bumps and repeated contact with the same object are
filtered so they do not instantly fill the meter.

At five stars, a pursuit may get a spike strip on a suitable connected road ahead. The
planner checks road width, buildings, water, traffic, terrain and visibility, warns the player,
and rechecks the site before deploying. There is no fixed Simonkatu trigger. If the route has
no suitable hidden site, the pursuit continues without a roadblock. Arrest scenes work for
cars and for players who get out; continuing clears the response and allows a later pursuit.

## Streaming without losing the world

Startup reads the selected city's core data and the small extension catalog. It waits for a
requested extension only when the starting location needs it. Other regions load on approach;
all catalog starts remain selectable on the map. A map jump waits for its destination before
moving the player, and closing the map cancels that jump.

Surface files contain whole polygons, sometimes extending far beyond their filename's tile.
Their index must contain bounds measured from the packed vertices. Unknown bounds are treated
as required rather than risking missing roads. The startup radius covers the visible fog
range; nearby and forward tiles receive priority with bounded concurrent requests and retries.

Installing a region appends collision geometry, prepared road and walking edges, traffic
signals, street markings, trees and buildings. It preserves existing actor objects, edge IDs,
player-taken cars and police state. Do not reset traffic as a shortcut when changing streaming.
Check both direct extension URLs and repeated jumps, a region seam loaded in either order,
and a failed request followed by a successful retry.

## Workflow

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev                # http://localhost:5173/?start=<place>
npm test                   # node:test, about a minute
npm run build              # must pass before a PR
```

Read-only snapshots are available through `window.openCityDrive` in the browser console.
Mutable inspection helpers are limited to development builds:

| Call | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `getState()` | Car, camera, traffic, trams, police, region/surface loading counts, loaded tiles, draw calls |
| `getLocation()` | WGS84 coordinates, local X/Z, street name, car and camera bearing |
| `inspectView({x, z, heading})` | Teleport to a mapped road or pavement point (paused) |
| `inspectCamera({eye, target})` | Fixed camera for comparison screenshots |
| `setDetailVisible(name, bool)` | Toggle a named detail group to measure its cost |
| `testPoliceIncident()` | Trigger the police response |

Useful keys: **V** capture mode (full resolution, no shake), **H** hide the HUD, **C** camera,
**T** time of day / weather.

## Rules of thumb

- **Keep simulation pure.** Physics, traffic decisions, police heat and camera poses are plain
  functions over plain data. Test them in Node; render them in the module that owns the meshes.
- **Frame time matters more than features.** Check draw calls and frame time in `getState()`
  before and after your change; aim for 60 FPS on a laptop at 1440×900. Batch by material,
  instance repeated objects, and hide detail by distance.
- **Real-world rules stay real.** Traffic follows mapped one-way streets, lanes and signals. Don't
  invent roads, crossings or restrictions; if gameplay needs a liberty (e.g. driving onto
  Seurasaari), document it where it's defined.
- **Keep it non-graphic.** Crashes, pedestrians and police stay arcade and non-violent.

## Pull requests

1. Open an issue first for anything larger than a fix, describing the player-facing change.
2. Keep the PR focused: one mechanic or fix.
3. Include:
   - tests for the pure logic (a regression test for a bug fix);
   - a short clip or screenshots, with the `?start=` link to reproduce;
   - before/after numbers if it touches rendering or simulation cost (draw calls, frame time, FPS).
4. `npm test` and `npm run build` must pass; CI runs both.
5. Include an area's listed maintainers when a change affects its scenery or data. Shared engine changes need checks across cities.
