# Third-party data and assets

The code is MIT-licensed (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). The data and assets below keep their own licences.
Redistributions must keep these attributions. The game also shows them in its Sources panel.

The built game includes [third-party software and font notices](public/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt),
served at `/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt`. Keep that file with a redistributed build. After changing
dependencies, run `npm ci` and `node scripts/third-party-licenses.mjs`; the normal test suite checks
that the notices match the locked runtime packages and bundled fonts.

## Map and city data

- **City of Helsinki open geographic data and Helsinki 3D:** building footprints, textured LOD2 models,
  streets, pavements, parks, trees, coastline, traffic lanes and signals, and 2025 orthophotos.
  © City of Helsinki, City Survey Services / Urban Environment Division, licensed
  [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
  Machine-readable provenance: `public/data/provenance.json` and `public/data/extensions/index.json`.
- **City of Espoo, city model data, fetched 9 October 2026:** © City of Espoo
  (Espoon kaupunki), [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
  The Espoo extension uses the open aboveground CityGML city model and its façade/roof photographs,
  street areas, centrelines, registered trees and district boundaries. Building bases are levelled,
  photo textures are repacked into atlases, and geometry is cropped for the game. See
  [Espoo's data and attribution terms](https://www.espoo.fi/en/open-data-of-the-geographic-information-unit)
  and the per-extension provenance in `public/data/extensions/index.json`.
  Its traffic lights come from Digiroad (CC BY 4.0); its coastline and water polygons are derived
  from © OpenStreetMap contributors ([ODbL 1.0](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)), with
  source geometry retained in `public/data/extensions/espoo/osm-water.json`.
- **City of Espoo open data** (area `espoo`: Keilaniemi, Otaniemi, Tapiola): the 3D city model
  (CityGML 2.0 LOD2 with 2024 oblique-aerial façade and orthophoto roof textures, WFS layer
  `bldg:building_lod2`), street areas (`tran:road_lod2`), street centrelines (`GIS:Keskilinjat`),
  trees (`kanta:Lehtipuu`, `kanta:Havupuu`) and districts (`GIS:Kaupunginosat`) from
  kartat.espoo.fi/teklaogcweb/wfs.ashx. © Espoon kaupunki, licensed

  [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). See `public/models/tram-sources.json`
  and `public/models/bus-sources.json`.
- **HSL city-bike station positions:** from the public station feed. See
  `src/parked-micromobility.js`.
- **Digiroad** (traffic signs, traffic lights, public transport stops, speed limits, vehicle
  restrictions and bus lanes; `npm run city:furniture`): © Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency
  (Väylävirasto), licensed [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), from the open
  interface at avoinapi.vaylapilvi.fi. Sign faces are drawn by the game from the sign descriptions; no
  sign artwork is copied.
- **City of Tampere open data** (pedestrian crossings, signalled junctions, bus and tram stops from
  geodata.tampere.fi; `npm run city:furniture`): © City of Tampere, licensed
  [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
- **Elevation** (`npm run city:terrain`; hills, lake and river levels): Finnish cities use the
  [Elevation model 2 m](https://www.maanmittauslaitos.fi/en/maps-and-spatial-data/datasets-and-interfaces/product-descriptions/elevation-model-2-m)
  © National Land Survey of Finland, licensed [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/),
  read from the keyless [Mapterhorn](https://mapterhorn.com) terrain tiles (terrarium encoding; see
  mapterhorn.com/attribution for the source of each area). Resampled to a 3 m grid, smoothed along
  streets and levelled on water.
- **Extension crop outlines and route centrelines:** derived from OpenStreetMap via OSRM and Nominatim.
  © OpenStreetMap contributors, licensed [ODbL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/).
  Used only to choose which municipal data to include.

- **Mapillary street-level imagery**: photos stay on Mapillary (downloads by `npm run photos:fetch` and
  `facades:photos` go to the git-ignored `data/raw/`). Written observations in `extensions/*/reference-notes.json` credit each image ID
  and photographer. Mapillary imagery is licensed
  [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
- **Mapillary street-level photos for façades** (`npm run facades:photos`): photos are downloaded
  only to the git-ignored `data/raw/mapillary/` for looking at and are never committed. Colours,
  storeys, window rhythm and shop-front types are written in our own words into
  `cities/*/facades.json`, which lists the image ids and capture dates used per building.
  © Mapillary contributors, [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/);
  `facades.json` is shared under the same licence. The city's Sources panel credits Mapillary.
- **Mapillary map features** (cities built with a `MAPILLARY_TOKEN`): positions and types of lamp
  posts, traffic lights, road signs, bins, junction boxes and other street furniture that Mapillary's
  computer vision detected in contributors' street-level photos, filtered and moved off the carriageway
  by `scripts/mapillary-features.mjs`. Each object in `public/cities/*/furniture.json` lists the
  Mapillary map feature ids it came from. These extracted features are distinct from user-uploaded
  imagery: the imagery's CC BY-SA licence alone does not establish a redistribution licence for
  Mapillary's extracted data. [Mapillary's Terms of Use](https://www.mapillary.com/terms), sections
  3 and 11, govern this integration and require a visible Mapillary logo linked to its homepage.
  **Before public dataset distribution, confirm the downstream redistribution rights for these
  entries.** Adding the required attribution addresses the credit requirement; it does not by
  itself resolve that licence question. Municipal and OSM entries in the same file retain their
  separately stated licences. [Mapillary's official map-data guidance](https://help.mapillary.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407521157138-Downloading-map-data-via-the-Mapillary-web-app)

- **Reference photos for places** (`npm run photos:fetch`, e.g. Keskustori in Tampere): current
  photos from Wikimedia Commons (each under its own licence, mostly CC BY-SA 4.0) and Mapillary
  (CC BY-SA 4.0) are downloaded only to the git-ignored `data/raw/photos/` for looking at and are
  never committed. A few of them are rectified (perspective-corrected) into wall and paving textures
  (`npm run place:textures`, `public/cities/*/places/<place>/*.jpg`); those textures are derivatives
  of CC BY-SA 4.0 photos and are shared under CC BY-SA 4.0 with the photographer credited (the
  sources file lists which photo each texture comes from). Everything else about the square's paving, trees, tram stop, lamps and landmarks are
  described in our own words in `cities/*/<place>-reference.json`; every photo used is listed with its
  author, licence, capture date and use in `cities/*/<place>-sources.json`. Keskustori credits:
  JIP, Drefer, kallerna, MOs810, Piquito and Tiia Monto (Wikimedia Commons) and jopparn (Mapillary).
  The reference files are shared under CC BY-SA 4.0. Google imagery is never used.
- **City of Tampere open data** for places: 3D building parts (heights), street parts (paving areas),
  the tree register (species, height class, girth) and public transport stops from
  geodata.tampere.fi, © City of Tampere, [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

## Assets

- **Granite material:** [Poly Haven Granite Tile 03](https://polyhaven.com/a/granite_tile_03), CC0.
- **Route trees:** [EZ-Tree](https://github.com/dgreenheck/ez-tree) by Daniel Greenheck, MIT. See
  `public/models/tree-credits.txt`.
- **Landmark references:** the per-landmark source files in `public/models/*-sources.json` list
  references, licences and what is measured versus interpreted. Reference photographs are not
  embedded in the game.

## Fonts

The interface bundles DM Sans, Manrope and Spectral locally. Their SIL Open Font License notices
are included with the files under `public/fonts/`. Playing the game does not request fonts from Google.

The game's 3D signs also use the Helvetiker, Optimer and Gentilis example typefaces distributed
with three.js. Their original font notices are preserved in `public/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt`;
they do not become MIT-licensed because the surrounding game code is MIT-licensed.

## Logos

The original worldhood globe, city highlight and wordmark artwork are included under the project’s
MIT licence. Embedded text outlines do not change the licences of the separately distributed fonts.

- `public/branding/bind-logo.svg`: the Bind wordmark ([bindlegal.com](https://bindlegal.com/)), used for
  fictional in-game advertising with permission. It is a trademark of Bind and is not covered by this
  project's licence.
- `public/branding/mapillary-logo.png`: unmodified official artwork from the
  [Mapillary press kit](https://www.mapillary.com/press-kit), displayed with its homepage link to
  attribute integrated Mapillary data as required by section 11 of its Terms of Use. The mark
  remains its owner's trademark; it is not covered by this project's MIT licence.

If you fork this project, replace or remove the Helsinki and Bind logos unless you have your own
permission. Retain the required Mapillary attribution if you retain Mapillary-derived content,
and check the applicable data rights separately.
